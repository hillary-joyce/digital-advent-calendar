# Dog Countdown Calendar

## What it is
A fun little app that allows you to create a countdown calendar to any date, revealing a new cute little dog each day.

This started as a digital advent calendar to count down the days until Christmas, but since this is the internet and digital chocolate is no fun, I used little pictures of dogs instead.

Halfway through December I realized that I could use this calendar to count down to other dates, and allow users to create their own calendars for whatever was important to them.

## How it works
When you visit the [website](http://dog-countdown-calendar.surge.sh/) you can create a new calendar by entering the date you're counting down to (yyyy/mm/dd) and a brief title for the event (like "Sarah's Birthday" or "New Year's Eve").

Then just click create calendar, and you will see an array of circles with cute dog pictures peaking out from behind your countdown numbers. The page will also give you the id of the calendar you just created, so at any point you can come back and enter the id on the homepage and check-in on you countdown.

## What I Used
This countdown calendar was build using gatsby.js and deployed to surge.
